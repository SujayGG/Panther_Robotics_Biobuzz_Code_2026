# The `ftc` MCP server

[`ftc-mcp`](https://github.com/jackulau/ftcMCP) is an MCP server that feeds an AI
assistant ~9,500 lines of verified FTC documentation: the full hardware API,
Pedro Pathing 2.1, FTC Dashboard, Panels, Road Runner, FTCLib, and Gradle
coordinates for every common library.

It matters because models' training data for these libraries is out of date —
Pedro Pathing v1 APIs, wrong import paths, `@Config` misuse. The MCP server
gives the assistant the current API instead of a remembered one.

It provides three tools — `scan_project`, `search_knowledge`, `validate_ftc_code`
— plus 49 documentation resources and 11 workflow prompts
(`create-autonomous`, `create-subsystem`, `tune-pid`, `setup-gradle`, …).

## Requirement

[Node.js 18 or newer](https://nodejs.org). Check with `node --version`. Nothing
else to install — `npx` fetches the server on first use and caches it.

## Claude Code — already done, for everyone

This repo contains a [`.mcp.json`](../.mcp.json) at the root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ftc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ftc-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

That is *project scope*: anyone who clones this repo and runs `claude` in it
gets the server, with no setup of their own. [`.claude/settings.json`](../.claude/settings.json)
pre-approves it, so Claude Code won't prompt for confirmation on first run.

Verify it inside Claude Code with:

```
/mcp
```

You should see `ftc` listed as connected.

### About `claude mcp add ftc -- npx ftc-mcp`

That command registers the server in **local scope** — your machine, your user,
and by default only in the directory where you ran it. It won't reach the rest
of the team, which is why the checked-in `.mcp.json` exists. The two can
coexist; if you'd rather not have the duplicate, remove yours:

```bash
claude mcp remove ftc
claude mcp list          # confirm what's registered and in which scope
```

The `.mcp.json` in the repo keeps working either way.

## Other editors

MCP is an open protocol, so the same server works anywhere. It is not
Claude-only, and it is not tied to the Claude CLI.

**VS Code (Copilot)** — already configured in [`.vscode/mcp.json`](../.vscode/mcp.json);
just open the repo.

**Cursor** — add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, or `.cursor/mcp.json` in the repo:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "ftc": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "ftc-mcp"] } } }
```

**Windsurf / Zed / other MCP clients** — same `mcpServers` block, in that
client's MCP config file.

**Android Studio (Gemini)** — Studio's own assistant supports MCP from the
Narwhal releases onward. Enable it under
**Settings → Tools → AI → MCP Servers → Enable MCP Servers**, then add the same
`mcpServers` block. Studio reads it from `mcp.json` in its configuration
directory:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/AndroidStudio<version>/mcp.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Google\AndroidStudio<version>\mcp.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Google/AndroidStudio<version>/mcp.json`

Whether your Studio build accepts a `command`/`args` (stdio) server or only a
remote `httpUrl` endpoint depends on the version — check the MCP Servers
settings page after pasting it. See
[Google's docs](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/add-mcp-server).
This is optional: our AI workflow runs through Claude Code in a terminal, and
Android Studio is for Gradle syncs, deploys, and logcat.

## Using it well

Start a session with a scan so the assistant knows what's actually installed:

> Scan the project and tell me what libraries and OpModes exist.

Then work in plain language. Good prompts for this project:

- "Create a field-centric mecanum TeleOp with slow mode on the right bumper."
- "Add a lift subsystem with dashboard-tunable target positions."
- "Set up Pedro Pathing and FTC Dashboard in the Gradle files."
- "My loop times are ~40 ms — what should I change?"
- "Validate `TeleOpMain.java` against common FTC mistakes."

Ask it to run `validate_ftc_code` on anything new, and always finish with
`./gradlew assembleDebug` before you take code to the field.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `/mcp` shows nothing or `ftc` failed | Run `node --version`; needs 18+ |
| Hangs on first use | `npx` is downloading the package — give it a minute |
| Still stuck | `npx -y ftc-mcp` in a terminal; it should start and wait on stdin (Ctrl-C to exit) |
| Suggested APIs look wrong | Ask it to `search_knowledge` before writing code — it may be answering from memory |
